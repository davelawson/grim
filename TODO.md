# SHIT THAT NEEDS DOING

## Authentication

- User log in
- Some kinda token on Endpoints
- Access to particular games

## Database

- sqlite3
  - how do we handle migration?
  - how do we dump the database?
  - connecting MySql workbench (or some other GUI app)

## Between Game Functionality

- Endpoints
  - Create Lobby
  - Join Lobby
  - Leave Lobby
  - Update Game Settings
  - Player Ready
  - Launch Game

## During Game Functionality

## End of Turn Functionality

# GAME DESIGN

This shit is moving to the GAME.md file.  Will soon be removed from here.

## Basic Mechanics

- Victory
  - Vote
  - Magical
  - Influence
  - Domination
  - Quest
- Trading cards
- Burning cards
- Generating cards
- Rumour cards
  Generated by the actions of other players, based on the type and magnitude
  Some rumour cards are simply added randomly
- Wizard's Tower
  Defined by a collection of things that have tags:
  - Mage's Skills
  - Minions
  - Artefacts
  - Events
- Global events

VICTORY:
Each path to victory would be a track with X positions on it.  The first player to fill their track wins.  Progress is visible, and the mechanism to oppose another player obvious.

ASPECTS:
Inherit qualities possessed by assets that are always available.  These represent the passive capacities of the Wizard's Tower.

RESOURCES:
Currency provided by assets that can be spent to take actions.

RUMOUR EXAMPLE:
  I undertake a smash & grab at a cathedral to liberate a demonic weapon.
  This can spawn rumours.  This rumours could be tagged with demons, church, city.
  (Future Refinement) These rumours can be stifled by some way.
  Other players with sufficient levels in one of the tags will be dealt an appropriate rumour card.
  (Future Refinement) Degrees of success on the tag comparison could result in different rumour cards.

MINIONS:
  Minions have a collection of Aspects that they passively contribute to the tower.
  Have a set of base attributes (ie. might, influence, acuity).

GROG EXAMPLE:
  You draw a door guard.  This is a simple grog that requires naught but gold to hire.  The guard can be activated to generate might.

WITCH EXAMPLE:
  This is a follower that might require a Wild tag to recruit.  The witch can take a custom action to update a wis card.
  
TEMPORARY RESOURCES:
  These are cards that can be played to generate resources.  Examples are Wis, Cash Money, Influence, Mercenaries.

ARTEFACTS:
  Cards that have been created by completing other actions (most notable the build artefact action).  Like spells they can do just about anything.  Some artefacts are permanent, others are discarded upon use, while others are destroyed upon use.

SPELLS:
  Spells require aspects.  Some spells require Wis.  Spells can do just about anything.
  Example Effects:

- create resources
- card alteration
- spawn events
- destroy a card
- create an assets
- card mechanics

OBSTACLES
  Played immediately when drawn, these cards represent obstacles that the Wizard may wish to overcome.  They often remain until resolved.

SHACKLES
  These cards don't do much other than fill up your hand with garbage.

CHALLENGES
  Sometimes a specific minion (or the mage) needs to directly overcome resistance.  Each challenge will be branded by a relevant attribute (ie. Might 6).  The greater the resources available to the challenger, they more likely success.

WIS
  Magic fuel needed to perform research and use powerful magic.  Some Wis is gained every turn based on the mage's specialization.  Addition Wis can come from challenge rewards, events, minions, artefacts, spells, and anything else.

RESEARCH WIS
  Played alongside a Wis card to create a spell or artefact design.

BLUEPRINTS
  Blueprints, once devised, remain in your library.  Each blueprint is a challenge, which can only be undertaken by the wizard.  Upon completion, the blueprint is destroyed, and the appropriate spell or artefact is added to you deck.

## Initial Deck Design

### Drafting

  Pick one of several cards several times to fill your deck.

### Static

  You simply start with a preset collection of cards.

### Meta

  Many of the initial cards create other cards, giving the player an opportunity to tailor their deck.  This concept doesn't work super well if we are playing only a turn every x amount of time.
